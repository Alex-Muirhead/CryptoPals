# Rust CryptoPals Solution

This repository attempts to encapsulate workings to [the cryptopals crypto
challanges](https://www.cryptopals.com/) using the Rust language.

The logic for the code is stored within [`lib.rs`](./src/lib.rs), with multiple
executable files being created for each set and challenge within the
[`bin`](./src/bin/) folder.
